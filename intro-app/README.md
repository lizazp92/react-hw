# My first Demo React App

## About

A basic demo with header, main, footer components.
There is a form with a text input in the main component. On form submit we receive an alert with the input's current value.
I used Bootstrap, scss, React icon library.

## What I found challenging:

Could not add checks for the input. I read a few articles but I think I will add them later;
No incapsulation;
Too many files.
